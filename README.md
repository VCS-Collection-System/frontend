# VCS - Frontend UI

[![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

VCS is an application used by large organizations to track COVID-19 vaccination and testing submissions globally and in accordance with regional standards and legal requirements. The application can alternatively be configured to record other submission types, if desired.

The frontend is one of 3 primary components (along with the backend and auto-approver) that comprise the VCS.

## How to build the VCS frontend

The build instructions are available in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
